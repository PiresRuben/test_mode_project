The engine employs a component-based architecture. Each module has well-defined interfaces, ensuring loose coupling and isolated development.

### 4.2 Module Breakdown
- **Rendering Module:** Handles shaders, textures, and communicates with the GPU.
- **Physics Module:** Implements collision detection and rigid body dynamics.
- **Audio Module:** Interfaces with audio libraries (e.g., OpenAL).
- **Input Module:** Abstracts device-specific input.
- **Game Logic Module:** Manages scripting and event coordination.

- **Physics:** `PhysicsEngine`, `Collider`, `RigidBody`
- **Audio:** `AudioEngine`, `Sound`, `MusicPlayer`
- **Input:** `InputManager`, `Controller`

### 5.2 Error Handling and Logging

- Utilize exception handling for critical errors.
- Implement a logging system to record runtime events and performance metrics.

## 6. Interface Design

### 6.1 Internal Interfaces

- Define clear APIs between modules using abstract classes or interfaces.

### 6.2 External APIs and File Formats

- Graphics API: Directx11
- Physics API: JoltPhysics
- Audio API: Miniaudio
- Window API: GLFW
- Maths API: GLM
- GUI API: ImGui

- Support standard file formats: OBJ (models), PNG (textures), WAV (audio).
